<h3>What is digital citizenship?</h3>
<p> According to Terry Heick on the web page teach thought digital citizenship is explained or defined by the quality of habits, actions that impact the ecology of digital content and communities. For example good habits could be offering useful feedback to people on how to improve their app or website and bad habits could be something in the form of cyber bullying or stealing people’s information.

<h3>What is and online activity?</h3>
<p>  An online activity is the interaction between people from one end to another with the use of online platforms </p>

<h2 align = "center">  <hr width = "300" color ="Black"/>Online Banking </h2>
<p>According to a Questionnaire that I got people to answer I asked the question ‘Have you heard of online banking. I found out that everyone that answered my questionnaire knew what online banking is.
Another question I asked was if in the person’s opinion do they think online banking is safe I could clearly make out that the majority of people (19 of the 25 people - 76%), think that online banking is mostly safe. Therefore I can make out that people don’t think that online banking is completely safe, but with promoting digital citizenship through safe uses of online activities people can be taught to be safe while using online banking for example being taught to make a hard password so that no one besides you can know what it is .

<h2 align = "center"> <hr width = "300" color ="Black"/> Social media </h2>

<p>According to a Questionnaire that I got people to answer I asked the question ‘ on a scale of one to ten how often do you use social media. From this question I saw with the data I got, I could make the assumption that people use social media very often and not too much people don’t use it at all or use it but rarely. Therefore many people could be in danger of the risks of social media and so people will have to be taught about the safe use of social media examples of this would be not going on or using illegal or sketchy social media platforms and to be aware of people that might make you do things that you would never normally do.

<h2 align = "center"> <hr width = "350" color ="Black" />Conclusion  </h2>

<p>In conclusion online activities can and will always have its disadvantages and dangers but with good digital citizenship and being taught on how to be safe and responsible online while doing your online activities, most to all dangers and disadvantages can be avoided.
